> Boussange, V., Vilimelis-Aceituno, P., SchÃ¤fer, F., Pellissier, L., *A calibration framework to improve mechanistic forecasts with hybrid dynamic models*. Accepted in Methods in Ecology and Evolution. [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.25.501365v4)  (2024)

## Content
- `src/` contains utility functions and types specific to the experiments presented in the manuscript, such as e.g. models and the loss function
- `scripts/` contains all scripts related to the actual simulation runs
- `figure/` contains all scripts to generate the manuscript figures and crunch the raw simulation results.


## Installation
All scripts are written in the Julia programming language. We recommend installing Julia with [`juliaup`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).
The scripts can be executed by activating the environment stored in the `Project.toml`, `CondaPkg.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files in the root folder.
To activate the environment in an interactive session, type in the Julia REPL

```julia
julia>] activate .
julia>] instantiate
```


## Getting started
To run a script, type in the terminal
```
julia --project=. name_of_the_script.jl
```

Start with
```
julia --project=. scripts/illustrate_converence/illustrate_convergence.jl
```
